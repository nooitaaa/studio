            <p>Hyper Inertia is a narrative that can be read in both directions, depicting a dystopian parallel world inhabited by two avatars constructed through dichotomous conceptual and visual pairs.

In an office late at night, the first avatar appears, immersed in a hyper-productive and multitasking spiral of self-exploitation and self-design. The second withdraws into his flat, in a bubble of stasis, idleness, and drowsiness, merging with the plants they surrounded themselves with.

The subtitles, composed through motivational phrases from Pinterest and quotations from philosophers such as Byung-Chul Han, comment on the narration with a cynical and rambling tone. The imaginative encounter between the avatars occurs across a threshold, a moment of abstraction, in the middle of the sequence.</p>
